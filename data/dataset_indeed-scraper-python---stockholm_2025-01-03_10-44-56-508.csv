"COMSOL Inc.","Are you as inspired as we are by the combination of multiphysics simulation, product design, and programming? Do you want to work in a team of driven and talented colleagues? Would you like to develop functionality for products used worldwide by tens of thousands of engineers? If so, read on.

Who We Are

COMSOL is the leading innovator of multiphysics simulation software for research and product development. The COMSOL product suite enables our users to solve challenging science and engineering problems, thanks to our intuitive and flexible user interface. We create the tools that drive new breakthroughs in science and engineering, and we love what we do. Founded in Sweden in 1986, the COMSOL organization boasts 16 offices and a distributor network throughout the world with more than 500 employees.

What You'll Do

In our newly renovated Stockholm office, we develop the core functionality of our multiphysics product family, used worldwide in research and development (R&D) and computer-aided engineering (CAE). Our software enables users to solve complex science and engineering problems, thanks in part to our intuitive and flexible graphical user interface.

We are now seeking a talented and motivated software developer to expand the team developing our user interface, communication and data layers. We develop both the frameworks other developers use to quickly create and update functionality within their areas of expertise, as well as core functionality in the user interface. The team is also responsible for the Application Builder, a tool our customers use to create their own simulation applications. This includes both a GUI designer integrated in our desktop modeling environment, as well as a code editor with access to the powerful external COMSOL Java API. Within the team, we also develop the deployment products COMSOL Server and COMSOL Compiler, which our customers use to share their Application Builder-made applications, and the Model Manager functionality for managing simulation data.

All of our products are shipped as off-the-shelf software packages that our users install onsite and manage themselves. We typically release new major versions of our products on a yearly schedule.

As a new hire, you will:

Work in a specific problem space, with the goal to gradually expand your knowledge within the many areas we're responsible for, with plenty of opportunities to learn and grow.
Take on an integral role in the full life-cycle of your code, from design to development, testing, feedback, improvement, and maintenance.
Help solve real problems for engineers worldwide.

Your day-to-day work typically involves writing code, reviewing other team members’ code, being involved in specification- and design work, testing and giving feedback on the team’s projects, and otherwise contributing to the overall health of the codebase. Most development is done in Java, but we also use C#.

What We're Looking For

You are passionate about problem-solving and not afraid to dig into existing code and make it your own. You are open-minded, value teamwork, and understand the importance of putting users center stage. You also care about code quality and understand the need for comprehensive test coverage, sense of code ownership, modularity, adequate performance-tuning, and good documentation. Beyond that, we are looking for someone with the following background:

M.Sc. or equivalent degree in engineering, computer science, mathematics or physics, or work experience in relevant programming positions
Excellent programming skills with proficiency in at least one object-oriented programming language, for example Java, C#, or Python.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Must be eligible to work in Sweden, but Swedish is not a requirement as long as you have good English skills.

Knowledge of physics or simulation is not a requirement, but interest in these areas will help to better understand our product and market.

What We Offer

At COMSOL, you will quickly play a key role within your development projects, where you will have many opportunities to suggest ideas and improvements. As the company is growing continuously, we strive toward making you an expert within your development area within a few years. Along the way, you will be supported by experienced colleagues in a collaborative working environment. In addition to an exciting career working on a sophisticated software product, we also offer a competitive salary, individual pension plans, and sponsored gym membership. We respect your leisure time and need for a work-life balance. We expect you to be onsite during the initial onboarding period. After that, we apply a hybrid approach that enables you to work from home a few days a week on average.

Our corporate culture is innovative, vibrant, and cutting-edge. We are committed to encouraging creativity through an exciting and challenging environment in which individuals excel and grow. We believe that our talented employees and an active learning environment are the keys to our success.

Job Description

This would not be possible without a state of the art core platform as the backbone managed by the dedicated SME teams in our Core Group. One such team is the Performance and Observability Team having two sub-tracks as the name implies.

We are looking to expand our team across the Observability sub-track. The position is ideally suited to experienced candidates from Software Engineering / SRE / DevOps backgrounds with deep focus on Observability stack and best practices.

Our team currently has four members, each having a diverse background and perspective. Together we own an observability stack that handles billions of metrics, traces and log entries each month. Our customers are all the engineers at Wolt who use this stack to understand the health of their services / infrastructure at scale.

As of today, we manage a complex observability stack, covering a wide scope from application instrumentation and telemetry data collection to visualization and alerting, spanning both backend and client-facing applications. Our daily responsibilities ensure that this ecosystem operates seamlessly. In parallel, we're building the next-generation observability platform, re-architecting our stack and pipelines in collaboration with our counterparts at DoorDash. This partnership provides an unparalleled opportunity to drive high-impact initiatives across the observability domain, offering empowerment and involvement in cutting-edge projects.

Qualifications

What you’ll do :

Be responsible for building and improving our observability platform and tooling, used by all Wolt engineers.
Contribute to initiatives focused on architecting, building, and maintaining our observability stack to efficiently handle increasing telemetry data with greater reliability.
Champion observability best practices, guiding and supporting other Woltians in this space.
Take ownership of key initiatives to improve the quality, efficiency, and reliability of our observability stack.
Apply your expertise in SRE culture and practices to ensure observability has a meaningful impact on our business.
Participate in the on-call rotation to address incidents and outages, resolving reliability issues efficiently.
Help standardize observability resources by building tools and documentation that enhance productivity and developer experience.
Triage and resolve production issues within the observability scope.
Contribute to open-source efforts by sharing some of our internal tools with the broader community.

Qualifications:

Proven experience in Software Engineering, SRE, or a similar role with a focus on observability, reliability, and scaling large systems.
You have experience with OpenTelemetry, which is a key foundation for much of the infrastructure and tooling the team is converging on as part of our future observability strategy.
Strong foundation in computer science principles and engineering fundamentals.
Proficient in development, particularly in Go (preferred) or Python, with experience building automation tools and software for large-scale, distributed systems.
Hands-on experience with observability tooling such as DataDog, Prometheus, Mimir, Elasticsearch, Grafana, Jaeger, and tracing systems.
Expertise in cloud platforms like AWS, GCP, or Azure, with experience managing cloud infrastructure using Kubernetes and containers (Docker).
Deep knowledge of building and maintaining reliable, high-performance, and scalable distributed systems.
Solid understanding of SRE principles, incident response, and designing fault-tolerant architectures.
Experience with infrastructure-as-code tools like Terraform or Ansible for managing cloud environments.
Familiarity with CI/CD pipelines, automated testing, and continuous delivery practices.
Strong analytical and problem-solving skills, with experience troubleshooting complex distributed systems.
Excellent communication and collaboration skills, with the ability to work cross-functionally to enhance platform observability and reliability.
Experience working directly with development teams, with a willingness to dive into application code for observability-related topics, even when unfamiliar with the application code.
Solid experience with Docker and Kubernetes, coupled with a strong foundation in Unix systems and networking concepts.
Open to feedback, recognizing that no one is perfect—including us. We see feedback as an opportunity to learn and grow together.

Nice to Haves:

You have experience with handling data and running monitoring infrastructure at scale, such as managing petabyte-scale Elasticsearch clusters or similar databases
You have experience operating distributed event streaming platforms at scale e.g. Apache Kafka
Open-source contributions in observability, cloud, or platform engineering are a strong plus

Resilient and proactive – able to maintain a clear direction and keep projects on track, even when facing unexpected challenges.

What you’ll bring

Deep experience with Node.js and TypeScript, with a focus on building scalable backend APIs.
Strong knowledge of Google Cloud Platform (GCP) services, particularly Firebase, Firestore, GKE, Cloud Run, and PubSub.
Hands-on experience with Terraform for infrastructure as code and cloud automation.

Experience with either Python, FRP and Ansible is a plus.
Having previously worked in an entrepreneurial/start-up environment.

We are committed to revolutionizing the industry with innovative software solutions that make managing properties easier, more efficient, and more effective.

Our cloud-based platform is unique, and in a brief time, we have proven ourselves as a leading and innovative player on the market. Our product development department acts as a SaaS supplier to all the companies in the Odevo group and several other players in the industry. Together, we will continue to challenge and change this industry. To continue our ambitious growth journey, we seek more great people to join us to build market-leading property management software products. Are you one of them?

As a Fullstack Developer, you will be part of a team that is responsible for our organization's AI-focused initiatives, creating transformative solutions for our business opportunities.

You will be pivotal in defining how we apply AI solutions to business problems. We want to deeply integrate AI across our organization, drive innovation and ensure that AI is a clear part of our business strategy.

You will be reporting to our AI Engineering Manager and working closely with our Head of AI Product.

You are an experienced and driven software engineer who has shipped applications to real users. Complex challenges do not deter you; they intrigue you. You tackle them methodically, finding practical solutions that truly make a difference.

You prefer working in a team with developers, designers and product managers and deeply collaborate with your team rather than working from specifications. You communicate effectively and can discuss the pros and cons of different options in constructive ways.

You find AI developments interesting, and have experimented with them, and are eager to learn more.

Responsibilities

Collaborate closely with cross-functional teams, including engineers, and product managers, to define requirements and deliver AI solutions that meet business needs.
Interested in learning more about the latest developments in generative AI, reading up on open-source projects and exploring AI technologies that can benefit the organization.
Create prototypes and proof-of-concepts to demonstrate the feasibility and potential of solutions to stakeholders.
Document architecture designs, algorithms, and best practices for knowledge sharing within the organization.

Qualifications

Bachelor's or Master's degree in computer science, Machine Learning, or a related field.
Experience in backend development using Python and FastAPI, and React for frontend development
Proven experience with building applications for real users, spanning design, frontend, backend, databases and infrastructure. We don’t require deep experience in all areas.
You will be asked to demo your experience in the interview process
Proficiency in Swedish

What we offer

Hybrid/remote work environment - you will be part of a team based in and around Stockholm that values collaboration and communication, regardless of location.
Professional growth - to work with the most talented developers in the industry.
Modern technology - we invest in the latest technologies and tools, we sign agreements with the largest players, and we encourage our team members to share their ideas and take ownership of their work to form a collaborative environment where AI is used throughout the group.
Innovation - to work on exciting projects that push the boundaries of our industry and make a real impact.
Commitment to quality - a dynamic and forward-thinking company that values profitable and long-term product development.

Location
We find great value in being able to work closely with our Stockholm-based team in person. At the same time, we understand the need to focus deeply without interruptions. Therefore, the team works according to a hybrid setup with 3 days at the Stockholm office, and 2 days remotely from home, combining the best of both worlds.

Excited?
If you are excited about being part of a successful team, we encourage you to apply for this position.

"Truesec","Do you want to be at the forefront of protecting our society against cyber threats? We are looking for an Application Security Engineer to team up with a passionate team of cyber specialists in our Secure Development domain.

Secure Development

Applications and custom solutions are currently popular targets for threat actors. In modern application development, security must be present throughout all aspects of the development process. Our engagements span from AppSec-related security workshops, educating organizations in secure coding and DevSecOps, to longer assignments where we write code responsibly as integrated team members. We are a cyber tech company with our own custom software and services that we leverage both during assignments and with our clients.

The Role

At Truesec, you'll have the opportunity to work with a variety of customers and their development organizations, providing technical solutions to help them improve their security, based on their needs and current circumstances. Your tasks may include assessing proposed or existing systems for security vulnerabilities, conducting code reviews to identify potential issues, and helping clients develop more secure development processes. A big part in what you will do is advising and educating customers on risk.

You'll also have the chance to engage in threat modeling exercises, which involve analyzing systems to identify potential security threats and developing strategies to mitigate them. In addition, you may participate in workshops and training sessions to help clients improve their security posture and ensure they are up-to-date on the latest techniques and best practices.

To ensure that you are well-equipped to handle these challenges, we provide ongoing training and support, including opportunities for continuous learning during work hours and attendance at industry conferences. Whether you are working independently or in a team, you'll have the technical expertise and resources necessary to help our clients develop more secure and resilient systems.

Your Potential Background

Application security is a broad area that encompasses a range of skills and expertise, and the right candidate for us could come from a variety of different backgrounds. If you are an application security engineer, you may have experience in threat modelling, vulnerability assessment, code review, or secure software development. You likely understand the importance of building security into the software development life cycle and are well-versed in industry-standard methodologies.

On the other hand, if you are a a developer with a keen interest in security, you might have experience implementing secure coding practices such as input validation, access control, and cryptography. You could also have experience with web application firewalls or other security technologies.

If you are a penetration tester, you probably have a talent for finding weaknesses in systems and exploiting them to show their impact on business operations. You might also be interested in vulnerabilities and vulnerability research.

Finally, if you are an information security professional with an interest in the secure software development life cycle (SSDLC), you may have experience designing and implementing security policies, procedures, and controls that support the development of secure software.

In short, we believe your previous experience could include:
• DevSecOps and secure coding practices.
• Software architecture and design.
• Programming skills in one or more languages, preferably within either Java, C#, C/C++, Python, JavaScript, or Go.

If you have experience in any of the following, we will consider it a bonus:
• Cryptography/Authentication/Authorization.
• OAuth 2/OpenID Connect/JWT.
• Distributed systems/Docker/Kubernetes.
• AWS, Azure, or GCP.
• Threat modeling and security assessments of code.
• Penetration testing.
• SAST/DAST tools.
• Vulnerability management.

Application security is a broad area and we know that even if you have a different background than the ones mentioned you could fit right in, so don't hesitate to apply.

"Anyfin","At Anyfin HQ, nestled in the vibrant heart of Stockholm, we’re on a mission to transform the financial world. By equipping people with smart, innovative tools, we’re changing how individuals manage their financial well-being on an international scale. Our vision is clear and powerful: to improve the financial health of every individual, one debt at a time.

About Us: Since our inception in 2017, we’ve helped thousands of Swedes, Finns, Germans, and Norwegians take back control of their finances, saving millions by refinancing costly consumer credit. But this is just the beginning. With new markets to conquer, cutting-edge tools, and ambitious products on the horizon, we are constantly seeking new ways to elevate people’s financial situations. And to reach these bold goals, we need passionate and talented individuals like you.

What You Will Be Doing:
As a Senior Node.js Developer at Anyfin, you’ll dive deep into building and optimizing complex financial backend systems. You’ll be part of a fast-paced startup environment, collaborating with driven colleagues who thrive on innovation. Our team values growth, diversity, and adaptability, and you’ll have the chance to contribute to impactful projects from your very first day.

Your Responsibilities:

Specialize in backend development, utilizing Node.js and SQL to build robust and scalable financial systems.

Tackle complex coding challenges, crafting new backend solutions, and refining existing ones.

Work with TypeScript, GraphQL, Postgres, and occasionally touch on React, but the backend will be your primary focus.

Contribute to the design and architecture of financial platforms, ensuring the scalability and reliability of our systems.

Collaborate with cross-functional teams to shape both product and business strategies.

Share your backend expertise with the team, championing best practices and continuous learning.

Who You Are:

Proficient in Node.js and backend in general. Experience with SQL databases (preferably Postgres) is essential.

You have a passion for solving intricate backend problems, especially in high-stakes environments like finance.

At least 5 years of professional experience in software development. Experience with financial systems is a huge plus.

A good understanding of system design, clean code, and pragmatic problem-solving.

Bonus points if you’re familiar with React, Python, Go, GraphQL,Kubernetes, Google Cloud/AWS or DevOps with Github Actions but your backend experience will take center stage here.

Why Join Us? We promise you’ll be challenged and pushed to develop your skill set, all while working alongside a talented and ambitious team. Though we’ve made significant strides, the most exciting part of our journey is just beginning. Plus, we offer competitive compensation, a cozy centrally-located office, extra time off on your birthday, and many other benefits we’ll tell you about when we meet.

Are you ready to be a key player in revolutionizing financial well-being? We can’t wait to receive your application!

We believe that innovation thrives in person, so we work from the office four days a week to foster collaboration and creativity.

Please note that we are not offering relocation support for this position.","<div><p>At Anyfin HQ, nestled in the vibrant heart of Stockholm, we&rsquo;re on a mission to transform the financial world.

Would you like to develop functionality for products used worldwide by tens of thousands of engineers? If so, read on.

Who We Are

COMSOL is the leading innovator of multiphysics simulation software for research and product development. The COMSOL product suite enables our users to solve challenging science and engineering problems, thanks to our intuitive and flexible user interface. We create the tools that drive new breakthroughs in science and engineering, and we love what we do. Founded in Sweden in 1986, the COMSOL organization boasts 16 offices and a distributor network throughout the world with more than 500 employees.

What You'll Do

In our newly renovated Stockholm office, we develop the core functionality of our multiphysics product family, used worldwide in research and development (R&D) and computer-aided engineering (CAE). We are now seeking a talented and motivated software developer to expand the team developing the COMSOL Model Manager — a version control system for managing simulation data. The Model Manager is fully integrated with our flagship product COMSOL Multiphysics® and enables our users to seamlessly store, search, organize, and share multiphysics simulations between colleagues and stakeholders within their respective organizations. Being a part of the COMSOL product suite, the functionality is shipped as an off-the-shelf software package that our users install onsite and manage themselves.

As a new hire, you will:

Work in a specific problem space, with the goal to gradually expand your knowledge within the many areas we're responsible for, with plenty of opportunities to learn and grow.
Take on an integral role in the full life-cycle of your code, from design to development, testing, feedback, improvement, and maintenance.
Help solve real problems for engineers worldwide.

The position involves both backend work on the storage and API layers, and some work on the desktop user interface. Most of the development is done in Java, some in SQL, and some in C# for desktop user interface components. Depending on your interests, the role can also cover frontend development in TypeScript and Vue for the web interface of the Model Manager server.

Your day-to-day work typically involves writing code, reviewing other team members’ code, being involved in specification- and design work, testing and giving feedback on the team’s projects, and otherwise contributing to the overall health of the codebase. The team organizes its work through a Kanban process that tracks a yearly release schedule for the product.

What We're Looking For

You are passionate about problem-solving and not afraid to dig into existing code and make it your own. You are open-minded, value teamwork, and understand the importance of putting users center stage. You also care about code quality and understand the need for comprehensive test coverage, sense of code ownership, modularity, adequate performance-tuning, and good documentation. Beyond that, we are looking for someone with the following background:

M.Sc. or equivalent degree in engineering, physics, mathematics, or computer science, or significant work experience in relevant programming positions spanning multiple years.
Excellent programming skills with proficiency in at least one object-oriented programming language, for example Java, C#, or Python.
Strong written and verbal communication skills.
Must be eligible to work in Sweden, but Swedish is not a requirement as long as you have good English skills.

Experience with the following will be valued when assessing candidates:

Larger software projects.
Design of user interfaces for desktop or web.
Design of APIs.
Mentorship of other developers.
Professional use of Java, SQL, Lucene, PostgreSQL (or some other relational database management system), Apache Solr (or some other search technology), Javascript, Typescript, Vue.

Knowledge of physics or simulation is not a requirement, but interest in these areas will help to better understand our product and market.

What We Offer

At COMSOL, you will quickly play a key role within your development projects, where you will have many opportunities to suggest ideas and improvements. As the company is growing continuously, we strive toward making you an expert within your development area within a few years. Along the way, you will be supported by experienced colleagues in a collaborative working environment. In addition to an exciting career working on a sophisticated software product, we also offer a competitive salary, individual pension plans, and sponsored gym membership. We respect your leisure time and need for a work-life balance. We expect you to be onsite during the initial onboarding period. After that, we apply a hybrid approach that enables you to work from home a few days a week on average.

Our corporate culture is innovative, vibrant, and cutting-edge. We are committed to encouraging creativity through an exciting and challenging environment in which individuals excel and grow. We believe that our talented employees and an active learning environment are the keys to our success.

Qualifications

• Education: Degree in a quantitatively focused discipline, e.g., experimental psychology, economics, computer science, physics, or similar.

• Demonstrated experience working with and influencing technical and nontechnical cross-functional peers and stakeholders. This will be a highly visible role within the People Team, and building trust with your colleagues will be critical.
• Tech skills: Python, SQL, R, AWS, and one of the modern BI tools (Tableau, Power BI, Looker, Sigma, or similar). Advanced SQL skills, and ability to write optimized queries for large data sets.
• Subject Matter Expertise: Deep expertise in data visualization and analysis. Some expertise in statistics is preferred (regressions, t-tests). Nice to have: Experience analyzing survey data.
• Since you’ll be taking care of our internal stakeholders, we’re looking for someone who truly enjoys interacting with people on a daily basis. The ability to search for information and ask relevant questions from various teams will be crucial.

"Forloop.ai","Company Description

Forloop.ai is a Swedish-Czech startup founded on the ambition to solve the problem that most (87%) of machine-learning projects never make it to production. Largely due to time, effort and complexity to handle data and data pipelines for ML.

To solve that - Forloop.ai provides an easy-to-use data pipeline and preparation tool, with personalised intelligent recommendations. Forloop.ai is a tool for Data Scientists to accelerate the mundane, yet critical tasks, of turning source data into model ready data.

Ultimately, Forloop.ai enables Data Scientists to focus on the creative aspects of data that drive the business forward.

We see that you excel in taking responsibility both from a technical and team aspect, and thrive in seeing the results. This is a key role for the company - you should enjoy the thrill of taking initiatives that drive forward the product, the team, and the company as a whole.

"Gilion","We're a group of engineers hailing from leading innovators like Spotify, King, Anyfin, Sinch, and Einride. We've joined forces with some of the brightest minds in banking to assist entrepreneurs in growing their businesses smarter and faster.

Traditionally, founders have been left to navigate the fundraising journey alone. Today, the industry is evolving towards data-driven investment decisions, where investors crave numbers and data-backed pitches. We think this shift is great since it fosters a less biased and more diverse innovation ecosystem. Gilion's mission is clear: develop tools and improved funding options to simplify the lives of innovative founders.

By connecting to the Gilion platform, founders gain access to a comprehensive analytics tech stack right off the bat. Our platform provides stunning visualizations that narrate the story of their company, without the need for a single line of SQL or CSS. Historical data, coupled with Gilion's advanced forecasting capabilities, simulates future scenarios, offering a unique understanding of performance compared to relevant peers. Check out this video to delve deeper into what we're all about.

"Pinetree","OFFER

Net Insight is a pioneering technology company that powers large-scale live broadcast events, connecting millions of viewers globally. Since 2021, they have established a rapidly expanding solution area focused on Synchronization. Leveraging their patented TV distribution synchronization technology, the Zyntai product portfolio is designed for nationwide 5G and power networks. We are now looking for an experienced C++ developer to join them!

Some of the benefits of working at Net Insight:

A world leader in media networks and resource optimization with a strong focus on innovation
Working with the latest tools in a very technologically advanced environment
Open and flat organization and good work culture with a lot of teamwork
Family-friendly company and a great understanding of pick-up/drop-off
Flexible working hours. You mainly report to your team
Unusually low turnover - High employee satisfaction!

THE PRODUCT AREA
5G Synchronization offers solutions to enable faster and more secure 5G rollouts. The core functionality is to distribute time over networks, GNSS independent, and with extremely high accuracy. The solution consists of new purpose-built hardware, advanced software-based automation algorithms, and a cloud-based management system. All are built with modern architecture and technologies.

The Synchronization solution is already making success for 5G worldwide and so far; Net Insight has established collaborations with large telecom operators in Europe and North America and over 20 nationwide TV networks.

For more info about the product, visit: https://netinsight.net/5g-sync

THE ROLE AND TEAMS
In this role, you will work in a smaller team of four to six other senior developers to further develop and improve Net Insight's unique solution using the latest C++ library. Given your experience and interest, there are openings in their two teams;

The Application team builds the application software and focuses on their algorithms for time synchronization. It is about using different time sources (atomic clock, PPS, GNSS, PPT, measurement of round trip times in the network) to be able to calculate the time at the nanosecond level in their nodes. If you have experience and/or interest in working with algorithm development and a mathematical background this is a good match.

The platform team works with the development of middleware, installation handling, monitoring, remote access, node control, and internal communication. They work with the layer between the FPGA and the application software and build in Linux (Yocto), device drivers, etc.

Some short notes from the teams:

We work with precise networked time synchronization. Think NTP, but four orders of magnitude better.
We use C++ 20 and Python for various tasks like test execution and glue scripts.
We take code review very seriously, not only to catch bugs but most importantly to share knowledge within the team. We sometimes do pair programming.
Interacting with other teams and team members is crucial for success.

YOUR PROFILE
Given smaller and self-autonomous teams there is a demand and wish that you thrive working in a more flexible/entrepreneurial way of working. This for example means a high degree of independence and initiative.

We think you are an experienced and social person who is used to working in close collaboration with other developers in agile teams; from system architecture, specification, and implementation of algorithms and functions to testing and verification. Even though you are a skilled engineer you still have a curiosity to learn and evolve but also share your expertise with others.

Seen to the technical elements, you need to have:

Good knowledge of modern C ++ (14, 17, 20) with standard libraries
Development of Linux applications
Solid knowledge and experience from TCP/IP and Network Communication

Good knowledge of Linux and systems with real-time requirement
Agile working methods such as scrum, TDD, and continuous integration

It is an advantage if you have experience in some of the following:

MPC, Model predictive control
Kalman filter
PI/PID Controller
Experience in cloud applications and cybernetics
Graph theory
Signal processing
Statistics
Optimization (in the mathematical sense)
Automatic control
Basic cryptography (TLS certs, AES)

We at Indivd are working to solve the immense sustainability issues within physical retail. One of the biggest issues is that visitors' behaviors are necessary to provide insights into which products the physical retailers should design and, and distribute.

Simply put, we're using sensors and AI/Machine learning to learn about customers and their behavior in retail environments. We do this without invading anyone's privacy. It's like a sci fi movie, but in real life ;-)

Our solution to this problem is a patented and marketing-leading anonymization method for image data which increases the ability to understand retail visitors while protecting customer privacy

Responsibilities:

Improving and building new version of our analytics platform, including:

Manage databases
Optimize computations
Health monitoring
Security analysis
APIs to customers
APIs to GPU clusters
Requirements:
Python
Django REST
PostgreSQL

Apache Airflow
Celery, Amazon AQS
Asyncio, aiohttp

Improving and building new version of our analytics platform and web systems, including:

Homepage improvements
APIs to customers
