At Zenseact, we’re seeking a passionate Computer Vision Engineer to join our talented team, Characters. Here, you’ll work with cutting-edge tools, collaborate with highly creative and motivated colleagues, and thrive in a culture that prioritizes psychological safety, diversity, and inclusion. We are deeply committed to sustainability, gender equality, and promoting a healthy work-life balance.

Interested in being part of something big? Apply today - no CV is needed at the first stage, only contact information. We'll cover the rest later.

Insights from the Team:

Team Characters is a tight-knit group of five expert engineers specializing in embedded C++ software development and classical computer vision algorithm design. Our core focus is developing calibration algorithms to precisely estimate the pose of multiple sensors like cameras and LiDARs mounted on a vehicle. Algorithm development, testing, and deployment are part of our daily work. This includes C++ programming of geometric computer vision methods to ensure high embedded performance while following the latest trends in the industry. We are also deeply interested in exploring methods that go beyond the classical computer vision track (e.g. Deep Learning) and comparing their performance. Our algorithms are versatile, and capable of operating online and offline in a controlled environment or while the vehicle is on the move.

We have already developed robust calibration solutions and take pride in maintaining and continuously improving them to meet evolving standards. We collaborate closely with other teams to ensure seamless calibration and develop production-ready code for safety-critical systems. Our team is close-knit and motivated by a shared aspiration for excellence. Our team meets issues and delivers modern calibration solutions.

Your Role and Day-to-Day Tasks:

As a C++ Computer Vision Engineer one day won’t look like the other and you will have a variety of different tasks as part of your responsibilities. A combination of new product development, integration and maintenance. Some examples are:

Developing vision-based algorithms for both offline calibration (calculating the calibration in a data pipeline) and online calibration (while the car is either operational or driving).
Writing and reviewing C++ production code guided by safety-critical standards in a Linux environment.
Taking part in testing on various levels such as unit tests, hardware in the loop (HIL), integration, and in-vehicle testing.
Driving all aspects of product development - from requirement analysis and concept development to implementation and testing.
Handle support queries, engage in dialogues with Volvo Cars (our main stakeholder) and address eventual Fault Reports.
Participating in forums and dialogs shaping the direction of the product.

You will also work tightly with the rest of the team, sharing insights, aiming to optimize our product and addressing technical debt in time.

Qualifications & Experience:

We are looking for someone who is able to guide projects and explore areas where not much information is given.

More about Zenseact

Our software makes a difference.
Using AI-based technology to create the ultimate driver support, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Every year, around 1,4 million people die in traffic while approximately 50 million people get injured. Many get disabled as a result of their injury. We can do better.

One purpose, one product.
We’re a software company dedicated to revolutionizing car safety. By designing the complete software stack for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Zenseact was founded by Volvo Cars, and the teams are based in Gothenburg and Lund, Sweden, Munich in Germany and Shanghai, China. When we aim for zero accidents faster, we strive to speed up the transition to safe automation. This is essentially achieved by making cars updatable – like a computer or a phone. With regular software updates, a vehicle can be made safer long after its production. By accelerating improvement loops, shortening development cycles, and deploying high-capacity software quickly, we can make cars safer, and faster.

Culture with people at heart
To achieve our mission of saving lives and ending traffic accidents we must go where nobody has before. It requires us to venture into the unknown, pioneering new technology and pushing the frontier of autonomous driving. While there’s no denying our determination and expertise, we must stand united to succeed. By fostering a culture of support and enablement – a place of psychological safety where all of us can thrive – everything else will follow. We call this a people-at-heart culture. This culture means caring. It means the company cares about me, and we care about one another. It means sharing, so we give each other energy and have fun together. Our culture is also about belonging. It’s important to feel at home and that we can be ourselves at work. Finally, a people-at-heart culture means well-being. So, we enjoy the flexibility needed to be and do our best – at work and in life.

Zenseact works proactively to create a culture of diversity and inclusion, where individual differences are appreciated and respected. To drive innovation we see diversity as an asset, which means we value and respect differences in gender, race, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, etc.

Interviews are held continuously, so we highly recommend that you submit your application at your earliest convenience.","<div><p><i>Do you have a passion for innovation and a knack for problem-solving?

About Irisity

At Irisity, we develop video analytics software for the security industry with great respect for personal integrity and privacy, focusing on detecting suspicious activity rather than exposing personal identity. Our system excels at the automatic detection of unwanted activity, such as intruders at construction sites at night, or people climbing roofs or breaking windows. We focus on detecting and preventing criminal activity without registering the identity of regular citizens. At sensitive installations such as schools, our system anonymizes all individuals to hide their identity, to make sure that the invasion of privacy is kept at a zero level. This way, our system can detect what happens and alert, leading to reduced crime rates and increased safety without any negative effects on personal privacy.

Irisity AB (publ) is a public company listed at OMX Nasdaq First North, with offices in Sweden, Israel, Hungary, USA, Singapore, the UAE and Brazil. We currently employ a staff of 90+ people within development, sales, support and finance.

The team works with a complex and versatile tech stack that orchestrates the framework and tools that supports or enables Zenseact’s feature teams to easily run, test and verify in simulation, on hardware and in vehicles. The main advantage with the orchestration is the fact that the target vehicle does not exist until very late in a project, have limited capacity or is just very cumbersome to work with when you need fast iterations. So, bring your talent and assist us speed up the iteration loop, providing better and faster feedback to the Zenseact developer community. Like to improve things?

More about Zenseact

Our software makes a difference.
Using AI-based technology to create the ultimate driver support, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Every year, around 1,4 million people die in traffic while approximately 50 million people get injured. Many get disabled as a result of their injury. We can do better.

One purpose, one product.
We’re a software company dedicated to revolutionizing car safety. By designing the complete software stack for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Zenseact was founded by Volvo Cars, and the teams are based in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Shanghai, China. When we aim for zero accidents faster, we strive to speed up the transition to safe automation. This is essentially achieved by making cars updatable – like a computer or a phone. With regular software updates, a vehicle can be made safer long after its production. By accelerating improvement loops, shortening development cycles, and deploying high-capacity software quickly, we can make cars safer, and faster.

Culture with people at heart
To achieve our mission of saving lives and ending traffic accidents we must go where nobody has before. It requires us to venture into the unknown, pioneering new technology and pushing the frontier of autonomous driving. While there’s no denying our determination and expertise, we must stand united to succeed. By fostering a culture of support and enablement – a place of psychological safety where all of us can thrive – everything else will follow. We call this a people-at-heart culture. This culture means caring. It means the company cares about me, and we care about one another. It means sharing, so we give each other energy and have fun together. Our culture is also about belonging. It’s important to feel at home and that we can be ourselves at work. Finally, a people-at-heart culture means well-being. So, we enjoy the flexibility needed to be and do our best – at work and in life.

Zenseact works proactively to create a culture of diversity and inclusion, where individual differences are appreciated and respected. To drive innovation we see diversity as an asset, which means we value and respect differences in gender, race, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, etc.

We are looking for a VCU Component and Automation Tester C++

As a VCU (the vehicle’s core computer) component tester you will be part of a test team within the scope of the Door, Locking and Alarm for verification and validation activities. The testers job is to fault trace, to write test cases and to document the trace and coverage analysis, mainly on the component VCU node.

This role also include writing test scripts for automation of test cases for other components and systems in the same domain. Test cases are written in vTestStudio and Vector based HIL rig systems are used.

The purpose of the team is to create the next generation functionality as well as improving the current solution. The team also handles quality issues, running changes and model year updates.

A component tester is not a pure SW tester. It is equally important to be able to test electronics and HW.

Deliverables and responsibilities
• Participate in the process of test system flow by defining test activities, equipment, asset under test and DUT (Device Under Test) preparedness together with requirement owner and suppliers.
• Be responsible for the VCU component verification, i.e. black and white box test, acceptance test and regression test on deliverables from supplier (both inhouse and external)
• Automate test cases in vTestStudio for Component-/Domain- and Complete testing in bench rig, HIL and on Vehicle. Test Cases to automate are from all functional areas within Door, Alarm and Tailgate not just VCU.
• Create and maintain automation test framework in Python and C++ (EMON).
• Test methods & test case development in Carweaver, planning and coordination of test activities together with rest of the team.
• Create Fault reports and assign to receiver in such way that an investigation and solution can be provided under function or system owners leadership. Review and communicate with suppliers’ test reports and results.
• Independently take logs and measurement on the component and actuators and signals.
• In collaboration with developer analyze logs to identify faults.
• Ensure the work is delivered as per specified acceptance criteria and definition.
• Read out and analyze nightly runs in our HILs

Needed Experience

More about Zenseact

Our software makes a difference.
Using AI-based technology to create the ultimate driver support, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Every year, around 1,4 million people die in traffic while approximately 50 million people get injured. Many get disabled as a result of their injury. We can do better.

One purpose, one product.
We’re a software company dedicated to revolutionizing car safety. By designing the complete software stack for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Zenseact was founded by Volvo Cars, and the teams are based in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Shanghai, China. When we aim for zero accidents faster, we strive to speed up the transition to safe automation. This is essentially achieved by making cars updatable – like a computer or a phone. With regular software updates, a vehicle can be made safer long after its production. By accelerating improvement loops, shortening development cycles, and deploying high-capacity software quickly, we can make cars safer, and faster.

Culture with people at heart
To achieve our mission of saving lives and ending traffic accidents we must go where nobody has before. It requires us to venture into the unknown, pioneering new technology and pushing the frontier of autonomous driving. While there’s no denying our determination and expertise, we must stand united to succeed. By fostering a culture of support and enablement – a place of psychological safety where all of us can thrive – everything else will follow. We call this a people-at-heart culture. This culture means caring. It means the company cares about me, and we care about one another. It means sharing, so we give each other energy and have fun together. Our culture is also about belonging. It’s important to feel at home and that we can be ourselves at work. Finally, a people-at-heart culture means well-being. So, we enjoy the flexibility needed to be and do our best – at work and in life.

Zenseact works proactively to create a culture of diversity and inclusion, where individual differences are appreciated and respected. To drive innovation we see diversity as an asset, which means we value and respect differences in gender, race, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, etc.

Interviews are held continuously, so we highly recommend that you submit your application at your earliest convenience.","<div><p><i>Are you an embedded C++ software developer who has experience in developing, integrating, testing, and continuously deploying software?

Our software makes a difference.</b><br>
Using AI-based technology to create the ultimate driver support, we&rsquo;re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Every year, around 1,4 million people die in traffic while approximately 50 million people get injured. Many get disabled as a result of their injury. We can do better.</p><p><b>
One purpose, one product.</b><br>
We&rsquo;re a software company dedicated to revolutionizing car safety. By designing the complete software stack for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems, we&rsquo;re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Zenseact was founded by Volvo Cars, and the teams are based in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Shanghai, China. When we aim for zero accidents faster, we strive to speed up the transition to safe automation. This is essentially achieved by making cars updatable &ndash; like a computer or a phone. With regular software updates, a vehicle can be made safer long after its production. By accelerating improvement loops, shortening development cycles, and deploying high-capacity software quickly, we can make cars safer, and faster.</p><p><b>
Culture with people at heart</b><br>
To achieve our mission of saving lives and ending traffic accidents we must go where nobody has before. It requires us to venture into the unknown, pioneering new technology and pushing the frontier of autonomous driving. While there&rsquo;s no denying our determination and expertise, we must stand united to succeed. By fostering a culture of support and enablement &ndash; a place of psychological safety where all of us can thrive &ndash; everything else will follow. We call this a <b>people-at-heart culture. </b>This culture means caring. It means the company cares about me, and we care about one another. It means sharing, so we give each other energy and have fun together. Our culture is also about belonging. It&rsquo;s important to feel at home and that we can be ourselves at work. Finally, a people-at-heart culture means well-being. So, we enjoy the flexibility needed to be and do our best &ndash; at work and in life.</p><p><i>
Zenseact works proactively to create a culture of diversity and inclusion, where individual differences are appreciated and respected. To drive innovation we see diversity as an asset, which means we value and respect differences in gender, race, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, etc.</i><br>

More about Zenseact

Our software makes a difference.
Using AI-based technology to create the ultimate driver support, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Every year, around 1,4 million people die in traffic while approximately 50 million people get injured. Many get disabled as a result of their injury. We can do better.

One purpose, one product.
We’re a software company dedicated to revolutionizing car safety. By designing the complete software stack for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Zenseact was founded by Volvo Cars, and the teams are based in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Shanghai, China. When we aim for zero accidents faster, we strive to speed up the transition to safe automation. This is essentially achieved by making cars updatable – like a computer or a phone. With regular software updates, a vehicle can be made safer long after its production. By accelerating improvement loops, shortening development cycles, and deploying high-capacity software quickly, we can make cars safer, and faster.

Culture with people at heart
To achieve our mission of saving lives and ending traffic accidents we must go where nobody has before. It requires us to venture into the unknown, pioneering new technology and pushing the frontier of autonomous driving. While there’s no denying our determination and expertise, we must stand united to succeed. By fostering a culture of support and enablement – a place of psychological safety where all of us can thrive – everything else will follow. We call this a people-at-heart culture. This culture means caring. It means the company cares about me, and we care about one another. It means sharing, so we give each other energy and have fun together. Our culture is also about belonging. It’s important to feel at home and that we can be ourselves at work. Finally, a people-at-heart culture means well-being. So, we enjoy the flexibility needed to be and do our best – at work and in life.

Zenseact works proactively to create a culture of diversity and inclusion, where individual differences are appreciated and respected. To drive innovation we see diversity as an asset, which means we value and respect differences in gender, race, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, etc.

Interviews are held continuously, so we highly recommend that you submit your application at your earliest convenience.","<div><p><i>Are you an embedded C++ software developer who has experience in developing, integrating, testing, and continuously deploying software?

The candidate we are looking for has a background including years of work within R&D developing products made of both software and hardware, at the level of the specific disciplines as well as at the level of the general product architecture, understanding the tight correlation between the different parts.

We are looking for you who have:

At least 10 years experience of programming in C.
Knowledge within Python.
Hands-on experience within HW.
Education in Electrical, Mechatronics, Engineering Physics or similar.
English in both speech and writing.
A great understanding of how hardware and Software interact.
A flexible approach regarding work tasks

Meritorious:

Experience in C++

Since this is a senior and hybrid profile, it is important that you have experience within both SW and HW. See requirements below.

As a SW developer:

Very good capability about development of applications written in C language (embedded systems), preferably on STM32 devices and with related development tools, is required.
Good capability about Python is required to create test setups.
Experience about DevOps and SW development methodologies, typical of environments where more Developers collaborate with systematic reviews.
Good understanding of communication protocols typical of industrial applications such as CANopen, Modbus RTU, Modbus TCP, is necessary. Competence about RTOS is very desirable.

Regarding HW:

Understanding of schematics of digital and analog circuits at a detailed level

Some understanding about EMC/EMI is important to be able to work with products processing power in the order of 10 - 1000 kW
Solid experience about use of measurement tools such as multimeters, oscilloscopes, logic analyzers, frequency response / vector network analyzers.

The role implies not only hands-on activity but also taking full technical ownership or a product, prioritizing the required improvement actions and achieving deep knowledge of the Product in order to direct the work of others, manage the discussions with stakeholders (Product Planning, Purchase, Manufacturing), provide recommendations for supporting functions like After Sales & Service. This includes work at the desk as well as in the lab. Proper documentation, although an occupation demanding a fraction of the overall time of engagement, is an integral part of the work.

More about Zenseact

Our software makes a difference.
Using AI-based technology to create the ultimate driver support, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Every year, around 1,4 million people die in traffic while approximately 50 million people get injured. Many get disabled as a result of their injury. We can do better.

One purpose, one product.
We’re a software company dedicated to revolutionizing car safety. By designing the complete software stack for autonomous driving and advanced driver-assistance systems, we’re fighting to end car accidents and make roads safe for everyone. Zenseact was founded by Volvo Cars, and the teams are based in Gothenburg, Sweden, and Shanghai, China. When we aim for zero accidents faster, we strive to speed up the transition to safe automation. This is essentially achieved by making cars updatable – like a computer or a phone. With regular software updates, a vehicle can be made safer long after its production. By accelerating improvement loops, shortening development cycles, and deploying high-capacity software quickly, we can make cars safer, and faster.

Culture with people at heart
To achieve our mission of saving lives and ending traffic accidents we must go where nobody has before. It requires us to venture into the unknown, pioneering new technology and pushing the frontier of autonomous driving. While there’s no denying our determination and expertise, we must stand united to succeed. By fostering a culture of support and enablement – a place of psychological safety where all of us can thrive – everything else will follow. We call this a people-at-heart culture. This culture means caring. It means the company cares about me, and we care about one another. It means sharing, so we give each other energy and have fun together. Our culture is also about belonging. It’s important to feel at home and that we can be ourselves at work. Finally, a people-at-heart culture means well-being. So, we enjoy the flexibility needed to be and do our best – at work and in life.

Zenseact works proactively to create a culture of diversity and inclusion, where individual differences are appreciated and respected. To drive innovation we see diversity as an asset, which means we value and respect differences in gender, race, ethnicity, religion or other belief, disability, sexual orientation or age, etc.

"Juniqx AB","Do you like the long-term perspective and the common focus of a product company? Are you looking for awesome colleagues, a central office and the opportunity to be involved and build something new from scratch?

Our customer is now looking for consultants who can work as a Backend Developer for the team that builds the next generation of the customer's cloud service.

Job description
As a developer in the backend crew, you will work with the development of the next generation of the customer's platform, which is being built from the ground up. You will work in small dynamic teams where all the skills to achieve jointly set goals are gathered. The team has a great mandate to make technical decisions and drives their own work forward.

Examples of what you could work with:

Implement authentication, throttling, etc. for their API.
Build on their low code language and its compiler.
Develop the building blocks of life cycle management for low code applications.
Optimize database queries to handle complex data flows.

Mandatory skills

Kotlin / Scala / F# / other functional programming
JVM

”Good to have” skills

Ktor
SQL (preferably PostgreSQL)
Docker
React
Typescript
Cypress

”Bonus” skills

Kubernetes
Python

Personal

We believe that you have a few years' experience of system development, preferably from a product company.
If you have a good understanding of the JVM, it is a plus and if you have experience of Kotlin and functional programming then we will be even happier, but the most important thing is that you have a genuine interest in programming and enjoy developing and learning new things. .
As a person, you are a team player who thrives in a helpful and supportive work environment.
You are used to taking responsibility and driving the work forward together with your team.
As they build from scratch and are in an expansive phase, it is important that you thrive in a changing environment and enjoy getting to grips with tricky problems.

Technology stack

The customer's backend is written in Kotlin, runs on the JVM and stores data in PostgreSQL.
Other technologies that you will come in contact with are Kubernetes and Docker which their platform runs on and React and Typescript which their front end is built in. Here it is also of course good with a good understanding, but it is not something you will work with every day.
They try to avoid complicating things unnecessarily and want the code to be easy to understand and maintain. To make it easier to do the right thing, they always do code review and have many types of automatic tests and static code analysis.

What does the customer do

The customer develops a cloud service, a low-code platform to be able to deliver tailored, process-based applications to its customers, primarily in Retail and Manufacturing. In the platform, they develop smart tools to quickly and securely build these applications, such as graphical modeling tools, code editors and validations. Customers then use their applications to e.g. coordinate employees, business systems and suppliers in their order-to-delivery process, but it can also be simpler applications such as expense registration or purchase inquiries.
