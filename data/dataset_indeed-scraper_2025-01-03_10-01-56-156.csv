We are continuously striving to increase the functionality and the reliability of the whole facility to meet the ambitious research requirements of MAX IV. It is an open and friendly group of 20 developers of diverse backgrounds, where continuous improvement and mentorship is part of our DNA. Agile and lean management methods help us stay focused on software development.<br>
<br>
Within the Software group we are establishing a development team dedicated to supporting the software used by the Macromolecular X-Ray Crystallography (MX) group.
<br>
The MX group at MAX IV operates two beamlines: BioMAX and MicroMAX. BioMAX that started user operation in 2017 is a highly versatile state-of-the-art beamline, geared towards high-throughput protein crystallography and automated experiments. MicroMAX that recently started user operation is optimized for microfocus applications and SSX for the study of protein dynamics. The MX group also operates FragMAX, a platform for crystallographic fragment screening. The international and interdisciplinary MX group consists of around 15 people.<br>
<br>
The new MX software team will work primarily on the MXCuBE data acquisition software and other software tools at the MX beamlines, with a strong focus on maintaining reliability while delivering the features needed to push the limits on Life Science.

"Joint Academy","Joint Academy is a global leader in digital treatment for chronic joint pain, connecting patients with licensed physical therapists. Our clinically validated programs combine individualised exercises, interactive education, and tracking tools to reduce pain and improve quality of life sustainably.

With operations across three markets and two continents, Joint Academy is now scaling up and looking for a Data Engineer to join the Data Team in Sweden. Data science lies at the heart of our innovation, and by joining us, you’ll help pioneer the intersection of digital healthcare and data science.

The Data Team

Our (small, currently one-person!) Data Team builds and maintains the infrastructure that powers mission-critical analytics, business intelligence, and machine learning solutions. Together, we strive to enable informed decision-making company-wide.

What we do:

Medical Insights: Analyse patient behaviour and outcomes to support our Science Team in publishing medical studies.
Business Intelligence: Build and maintain robust data infrastructure for high-performing BI solutions.
UX Support: Deliver in-depth analysis of user behaviour to guide app development and improve user experience.
Data Science and AI: Develop and deploy statistical and machine learning models for cutting-edge product features and services.

The Role

As a Data Engineer, you’ll focus on the critical “plumbing” that enables data science and analytics. With a strong foundation in computer science and a deep understanding of software systems, you’ll ensure that our data infrastructure keeps pace with growing data inflows from diverse sources.

We’re transitioning our backend from a Rails monolith to a Go-based microservices platform and shifting from ETL to an ELT approach using dbt and columnar databases.

What you’ll do:

Build and maintain our data platform, supporting both legacy ETL workflows (Python-based) and ELT pipelines.
Design scalable solutions for integrating new data sources and types, enhancing our ELT-based approach.
Collaborate with stakeholders to deliver insightful answers to data-related questions.
Integrate with third-party APIs and systems to import/export data, enabling key business processes to function optimally.

We are very proud of our product and the fact that it helps thousands of people reduce pain and improve quality of life and therefore it’s important that you also value quality and are keen to take ownership in what you deliver. We are constantly challenging ourselves and trying to find ways to improve, and that’s something that we will expect from you too.

Requirements

We’re looking for an analytical, curious engineer who loves solving complex problems and thrives in a collaborative, dynamic environment.

"Neo4j","About Neo4j:

Neo4j is the leader in Graph Database & Analytics, helping organizations uncover hidden patterns and relationships across billions of data connections deeply, easily, and quickly. Customers use Neo4j to gain a deeper understanding of their business and reveal new ways of solving their most pressing problems. Over 84% of Fortune 100 companies use Neo4j, along with a vibrant community of 250,000+ developers, data scientists, and architects across the globe.

At Neo4j, we’re proud to build the technology that powers breakthrough solutions for our customers. These solutions have helped NASA get to Mars two years earlier, broke the Panama Papers for the ICIJ, and are helping Transport for London to cut congestion by 10% and save $750M a year. Some of our other notable customers include Intuit, Lockheed Martin, Novartis, UBS, and Walmart.

Neo4j experienced rapid growth this year as organizations looking to deploy generative AI (GenAI) recognized graph databases as essential for improving it’s accuracy, transparency, and explainability. Growth was further fueled by enterprise demand for Neo4j’s cloud offering and partnerships with leading cloud hyperscalers and ecosystem leaders. Learn more at neo4j.com and follow us on LinkedIn.

Our Vision:

At Neo4j, we have always strived to help the world make sense of data.

As business, society and knowledge become increasingly connected, our technology promotes innovation by helping organizations to find and understand data relationships. We created, drive and lead the graph database category, and we’re disrupting how organizations leverage their data to innovate and stay competitive.

The Team:

The team is responsible for the core user-facing features of the Aura cloud platform and provides a foundation for other teams to build tooling. Additionally, we handle everything from internal APIs and customer support tooling to maintaining our build and deployment pipelines. You can be part of a strategically important team and build features used by many of the largest enterprises in the world.

We are looking for full-stack engineers who are fluent in front-end technologies and confident working on the server-side part of the stack. Relevant server-side experience includes the design and development of HTTP APIs, implementation of data persistence logic, and integration with third-party services.

The Role:

As a Software Engineer in the Aura Console team you will be contributing to building key pieces of technology infrastructure that will be used by thousands of users all around the world. Most of our users are other mission-critical systems which demand high availability and reliability. You'll be creating technical infrastructure that must scale and adapt to the diverse needs of all users. If you're interested in going to a deeper level of technical detail, this could be the role to gain that knowledge and explore new and challenging technologies beyond what you'll find in a typical end-user application.

Production experience with several of the technologies we use is desirable but not essential. You should have strong Javascript/Typescript skills. Our services layer is Python-based, so you should know Python well, or be interested in picking it up.

Our engineers work in both our Malmö and London offices and most teams are split across the two, so you must be comfortable working as part of a distributed team. We use extensive automated testing, so proficiency with a range of approaches from unit testing up to full-stack integration testing will be helpful.

The technologies we use most are:

JavaScript/TypeScript and React in the Browser
Python, Docker, and Kubernetes on the server
GCP, AWS, and Azure

"Minut","The role

Minut is on a steep growth trajectory. We serve tens of thousands of customers with even more properties worldwide. Web, mobile, API clients, and sensors make millions of requests to our systems every hour.
As a team, our job is to ensure high availability to deliver immediate insights from the properties that our customers manage. More than once, we’ve helped customers detect fires and events that may have caused harm to both properties and people.
We’re proud of the technical quality of our code and systems, and with this role, we hope to take that even further.
As a senior backend engineer, you will be part of an autonomous team of engineers responsible for everything from development and testing to architecture and operations.

What you'll do

Design, build, and scale Minut’s systems to handle one to two orders of magnitudes more customers and devices
Deliver new features that solve real life problems that our users experience every day.
Strive towards the infamous five-nines of availability by building resilience into the systems that ensure we can deliver on-time insights 24/7
Lead by example by delivering high-quality code with robust tests, drive architectural decisions, and share best-practices with your colleagues
Coach and mentor junior engineers to excel in their roles.

What you bring

You want to be part of a team where the whole technology stack, from hardware to apps, is developed in-house, and you interact with everyone involved
You have significant experience from several projects with a large number of users and a high-traffic load hosted in a cloud environment
You're curious and enjoy technical discussions
You enjoy the challenge of keeping both a high pace and quality
You are used to dealing with databases with terabytes of data and have experience migrating and managing them
You constantly find new ways to automate and improve tools and CI/CD pipeline
You have experience working with the tools in our technology stack (Node.js, TypeScript, MongoDB, SQL, Python, Git, Docker, Kubernetes, AWS)
Excellent communication skills in English are a requirement, but Swedish is not

The team you'll join

Minut's product and engineering team consists of 20+ engineers and designers. We come from various backgrounds, including Google, Axis, Jayway, and high-profile startups. Our expertise ranges from hardware design to deep neural networks to lively app animations. We like to say that we're a truly full-stack company with plenty of opportunities to work in all areas of the engineering team (and wider in the company)!

Benefits

Co-ownership – You'll receive a stock option package of KPOs (kvalificerade personaloptioner). If the company value increases, so does the value of your stake.
Learning – Be part of an environment highly focused on knowledge and developing new skills.
Impact – Join a small yet expanding team of core developers, and have a large impact on the culture and practices within the company.
Work from our office in central Malmö, remote, or a mix of the two.
Off-sites – Hackathons and company-wide retreats in beautiful locations a few times a year.
Relocation package. If you’re not in Malmö and want to move to the city, we’ll help you relocate. Unfortunately, we can't sponsor visas at this time.
Wellness Grant (friskvårdsbidrag) – up to 5000 SEK/year
Occupational pension (tjänstepension)

About us

Minut is a technology company that builds hardware and software for Airbnb hosts, property managers, and hoteliers. Customers use our services to provide better guest and tenant experiences, protect their properties, and prevent noise and nuisance complaints from neighbors.
We believe monitoring homes and properties shouldn’t compromise the privacy of those who stay and live there. To do so, we develop advanced AIs that run and process data on the edge.
Since the company’s inception, we’ve grown with our customers. While we started out with Airbnb hosts, our product and technology developments have allowed us to expand to adjacent markets with incredible growth potential. Today, for instance, we’re seeing significant interest in our cigarette smoke detection capabilities from residential property managers.

A fair chance

Minut is open to applications from all sections of society. We believe that you should be fit to work in this role, motivated, and experienced enough, regardless of ethnicity, belief or religion, family structure, sexual orientation or gender identity, or anything else that makes you, you.","<div><h4 class=""jobSectionHeader""><b>The role</b></h4><p>
